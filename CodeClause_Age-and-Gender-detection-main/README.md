# Age and Gender Detection using Python
This is a repository that contains code and instructions for performing age and gender detection using Python.

## Overview
Age and gender detection is a computer vision technique used to identify the age and gender of individuals in images or video streams. The process involves building a machine learning model that is trained on a dataset of images with known ages and genders.

This project provides a step-by-step guide for building an age and gender detection model using Python. The process involves data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
OpenCV
NumPy
Pandas
TensorFlow
Keras

## Results
The age and gender detection model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the test set. The model can accurately predict the age and gender of individuals in images and video streams, making it a valuable tool for various applications, such as security systems and marketing research.
